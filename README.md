# time-serie-RNAseq-analysis

**About the project**

During my internship in a team studying chronobiology, one of my tasks was to set up an automated pipeline for analyzing RNA-seq data from time-series experiments. To achieve this, I relied on the documentation provided by the library preparation kit supplier, as well as publications and repositories available in the references.
